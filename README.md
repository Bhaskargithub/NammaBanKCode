Business case: A microfinance scheme Sponsored by the state Govt in India has helped the middle class families to be self sufficient in quick financial support. This encouraged inidividuals to form a group and collect a minimal amount from every group member and the collected amount to be used as loan by team members (only) at very low rate of interest and repayment in terms of monthly installment . These transactions are monthly basis and only internal paper work involved. Advantages: No need to go to bank or an individual for quick loan. The interest amount paid is shared among the group

NammaBank Applicaiton: The whole process is run on paper work hence developing an applicaiton to cater various needs of the groups. This accounting is labourious and needs to maintain 5 books for a group, hence my application will support this accounting services.
